## What is Gradle?

Gradle is a modern build automation tool used in software projects to compile code, run tests, package applications, and more. It supports multiple languages and provides powerful dependency management features. Gradle’s flexibility allows it to integrate seamlessly with various environments and frameworks.

Key features:
- Supports Java, Kotlin, Groovy, and other JVM-based languages.
- Provides dependency management for libraries and frameworks.
- Automates repetitive tasks like compiling code and creating JAR files.

You can learn more about Gradle [here](https://gradle.org/).
